Desktop "Journaling" app for use with the online game, Pax Dei developed by Mainframe Industries.

This app allows the user to record their own personal journal entries as well as information on clans and other players and share this information to discord via a webhook. Currently in use with the [Lakeside Lantern](https://discord.gg/XFTUsKspPy) on Discord!

Current Update: New UI scheme, graphics and the ability to save players to an address book that can be used to send letters or notes to a defined discord channel.

This app is a work-in-progress and will receive future updates and adjustments based on community feedback and needs.

Note: Not responsible for loss of limbs, erratic explosions or wayward children.
