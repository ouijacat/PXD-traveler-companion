Desktop "Journaling" app for use with the online game, Pax Dei developed by Mainframe studios.

This app allows the user to record their own personal journal entries as well as information on clans and other players and share this information to discord via a webhook. Currently in use with the [Lakeside Lantern](https://discord.gg/XFTUsKspPy) on Discord!

This app is a work-in-progress and will receive future updates and adjustments based on community feedback and needs.
